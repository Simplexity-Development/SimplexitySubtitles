## Is there a working version out?

Still working on stuff, here is what we got so far...

- Subtitles lack directional arrows which is one of the main features missing right now.
  - Planning on adding yaw (left/right) and pitch (up/level/down) arrows.
- Subtitles are derived directly from the file names.
  - Planning on adding a language file to pull names from, but this is the fallback system.
- Subtitles are colored based on their categories.
  - Planning to allow the player to toggle which categories are Subtitled.
  - Planning to allow the player to select which color represents each category.

There are a lot of TODOs scattered around the code for things I want to add and do.
